# EDA and Statistical Visualization

This project explores techniques for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the interpretation of **statistical graphs** within a fictitious accounting scenario. The aim is to demonstrate how various EDA methods can uncover patterns, insights, and data cleaning needs to enable accurate analysis.

## Overview

This project addresses fundamental questions such as:
- How to interpret **histograms** and **boxplots**?
- What impact do **outliers** and **missing values** have on graph interpretation?
- How to identify and treat data issues for reliable analysis?

Based on fictitious data that mimics real-world accounting scenarios, this project provides practical examples of analysis steps reflecting typical challenges and best practices in data analysis for accounting.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Dictionary**: Explanation of key variables such as `id`, `release_date`, `debit_account`, `credit_account`, `amount`, among others.
2. **Packages Used**: Import and setup of essential packages for data manipulation and visualization (`pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`).
3. **Data Loading and Understanding**: Initial steps to load and review the dataset structure.
4. **Initial Exploratory Analysis**: Preliminary data analysis to identify issues like missing values and outliers.
5. **Missing Values Treatment**: Techniques for imputing missing values in both numerical and categorical variables.
6. **Outlier Treatment**: Approach to identifying and handling outliers.
7. **Final Exploratory Analysis**: Enhanced visualizations after data cleaning, including histograms, boxplots, and correlation analysis.

## Visualization Examples

The project includes visualizations to help interpret the cleaned data:
- **Histograms** and **Boxplots** for distribution and skewness analysis.
- **Correlation Heatmaps** to observe relationships between quantitative variables.
- **Scatter Plots** to explore non-trivial patterns between variables.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages:
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **SciPy**
