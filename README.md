EDA and Statistical Visualization in Accounting Context
This project explores techniques for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the interpretation of statistical graphs within a fictitious accounting scenario. The aim is to demonstrate how various EDA methods can uncover patterns, insights, and data cleaning needs to enable accurate analysis.

# Overview
This project addresses fundamental questions such as:

# How to interpret histograms and boxplots?
What impact do outliers and missing values have on graph interpretation?
How to identify and treat data issues for reliable analysis?
Based on fictitious data that mimics real-world accounting scenarios, this project provides practical examples of analysis steps reflecting typical challenges and best practices in data analysis for accounting.

# Project Structure
## Data Dictionary: 
Explanation of key variables such as id, release_date, debit_account, credit_account, amount, among others.
## Packages Used: 
Import and setup of essential packages for data manipulation and visualization (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
## Data Loading and Understanding: 
Initial steps to load and review the dataset structure.
## Initial Exploratory Analysis: 
Preliminary data analysis to identify issues like missing values and outliers.
## Missing Values Treatment: 
Techniques for imputing missing values in both numerical and categorical variables.
## Outlier Treatment: 
Approach to identifying and handling outliers. Â 
## Final Exploratory Analysis: 
Enhanced visualizations after data cleaning, including histograms, boxplots, and correlation analysis.

# Visualization Examples
The project includes visualizations to help interpret the cleaned data:

# Histograms and Boxplots for distribution and skewness analysis.
Correlation Heatmaps to observe relationships between quantitative variables.
Scatter Plots to explore non-trivial patterns between variables.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following packages:

pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

SciPy
